# JAVA-Programs 📁

A collection of small to medium Java programs and practice code — from beginner-level examples to utility scripts — gathered in one place for learning, experimentation, and reference.

---

## 📋 What this repository contains

This repo holds a variety of Java programs and code snippets, including but not limited to:

- Basic console-based Java applications  
- Utility tools / helper classes  
- Learning experiments (OOP, collections, file I/O, data structures)  
- Example implementations of algorithms / problem-solving code  
- Practice projects for improving Java skills  

> ⚠️ This is not a single “product” or one monolithic application — it’s a **collection of many small independent Java files / mini-projects**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the Java programs locally:

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GoulikarRamcharan/JAVA-Programs.git
   cd JAVA-Programs
Choose the file or folder you want to run.

Compile the Java file (from project root or file folder). For example:

bash
Copy code
javac path/to/YourProgram.java
Run the compiled class:

bash
Copy code
java path.to.YourProgram
(Optional) If you use an IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ / VS Code), just open the folder as a project and run the classes directly.

🎯 Recommended Usage
✅ Use this repo to learn Java basics — syntax, data structures, file handling, etc.

✅ Use it for reference — e.g. copy a utility class or algorithm when you need it.

✅ Use it to practice coding: try modifying, extending or improving the code.

✅ Use it for interview preparation or algorithm practice — many small standalone programs are easier to test.

🧑‍💻 How to Contribute
If you want to add your own Java program / script:

Create a new folder or file under the root with a meaningful name.

Keep naming consistent and add brief comments at top about what the program does.

Optionally add a short README inside that folder describing its purpose.

Make sure code compiles cleanly and follows Java conventions.

Submit a Pull Request — I’ll review and accept if appropriate.

💡 Why This Repository is Useful
It’s a single place to collect many useful Java snippets and programs.

Great for beginners to quickly look at working Java examples.

Helps you reuse and learn — no need to re-implement basic utilities from scratch.

Encourages hands-on practice: easy to run, experiment with, and modify.

📄 License & Usage Note
You’re free to browse, copy, modify, and use any code in this repository for learning and personal projects.
If you use code for larger or production systems, review and adapt appropriately.
